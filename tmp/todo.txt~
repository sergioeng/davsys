(1) Insertion data script
    Test data

(2) Record how many times each question was asked for a given user:

DONE 
This is to mimic what we do for the app when we keep track of how many times each question is asked.   
This is done to prevent the same questions from appearing every time.   
The query to the database is done by sorting the questions by the lowest count.  
You will need to modify the new table I create for storing user questions counts. 
DONE 

This table will get a new entry every time a user gets asked a question they have never been asked before. 
And it will update a row every time they are asked a question that has already been asked before. 
This table information is used for determining what questions to ask the user. 

The last problem really Lead to a 4th issue for you to work on..  Which is picking questions based on their question count history. 
That is a bit more complicated and I would like to go over that with you tonight.

(3) Before loading the next question either
    a - display an alert saying the next question is being loaded
    b - greyout the "continue" button
    
(4) Add reference to the ResultsPage
